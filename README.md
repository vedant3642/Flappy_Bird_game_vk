# Flappy_Bird_game_vk
A simple Flappy Bird clone built using Python and Pygame. This project recreates the classic side-scrolling arcade game where the player controls a bird, navigating it through gaps between pipes without crashing. Great for learning game development fundamentals like collision detection, animation, and game loops.
