# 🐤 Flappy Bird Game 

A fun and beginner-friendly **Flappy Bird clone** built with **Python** and **Pygame**. This project recreates the iconic side-scrolling arcade game where you guide the bird through pipes without crashing!

It's a great hands-on project to learn the basics of **game development**, including collision detection, animation, physics, and game loops.
